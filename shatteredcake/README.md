# Reflection

Here I hit a timeout error when I parsed every point in the input. After some memoization limiting the amount of parsing my implementation passed. As a note, there are solutions in haskell 8 times faster than my own. Is there a better way to memoize or parse? Maybe even read? I'm not completely certain where I could have speed ups.

It might be worthwhile to profile this code and figure out where I might be able to speed up.
