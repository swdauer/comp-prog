## My Thoughts

Here I'll just do a simple comparison between the 3 input numbers to sort them then I'll iterate over the second line's string and print the numbers as I do. The question is: how do I minimize the number of comparisons between the 3 input numbers to sort them?

I think it's two comparisons in best case and three in worst case.
